# Automated-Gateways

This project aims to improve blockchain interoperability by developing smart contract gateways that can interact with multiple networks, automating and securing transaction submissions. It involves creating gateways for different blockchain networks, starting with Hyperledger Fabric, and later expanding to other networks like Hyperledger Indy and Besu. The project focuses on evaluating system-level integrations through an extensive network of blockchains. The objective is to enhance efficiency, security, and traceability of cross-blockchain transactions, ultimately improving the functionality of blockchain technology.
