# Automated-Gateways

We introduces an innovative automated gateway framework, specifically designed to address challenges associated with data and service sharing across diverse blockchain platforms. The solution presented here leverages smart contracts within established blockchain platforms, serving as a means to ascertain and regulate authorization policies. This strategic approach significantly mitigates the necessity to acquire proficiency in new technologies, concurrently reducing reliance on third-party services. Until version 1.0.9, we created the ability of invoking smart contracts on different blockchain, through which  data and services can be shared among different blockchains. So basically, Automated Gateways ,in its current stage, can safely connect smart contracts on different hyperledgers to each others, through which Hyperledger Networks can share their services and data

Using three smart contracts as the foundation of authentication and authorization, the Automated Gateways module becomes a simple and secure method for Hyperledger fabrics to exchange their services and data through smart contracts. When a user adds this module to their code and deploys three predetermined smart contracts, they can grant access to their services to other Hyperledger fabrics. Additionally, they can access services from smart contracts deployed on other Hyperledger fabrics. By using this method, various Hyperledger fabrics can connect with each other and utilize each other's services.

This module offers users both an API and a CLI. With these tools, users can grant access to their services to other blockchains. Moreover, they can also invoke services on external blockchains.

 This contract-calls interoperability  can enhance the connectivity of Hyperledger Fabric, reduce the need for extensive documentation and protocols to link different blockchains, and ultimately minimize service redundancy within the Hyperledger Fabric community.
