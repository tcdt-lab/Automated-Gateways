# Automated-Gateways

Automated Gateways is a secure solution which can make Contarct-Call interoperatibility happen between Hyperledger Fabrics with minimal efforts,through wich blockchains networks can share data and services.

Using three smart contracts as the foundation of authentication and authorization, the Automated Gateways module becomes a simple and secure method for Hyperledger fabrics to exchange their services and data through smart contracts. When a user adds this module to their code and deploys three predetermined smart contracts, they can grant access to their services to other Hyperledger fabrics. Additionally, they can access services from smart contracts deployed on other Hyperledger fabrics. By using this method, various Hyperledger fabrics can connect with each other and utilize each other's services.

This module offers users both an API and a CLI. With these tools, users can grant access to their services to other blockchains. Moreover, they can also invoke services on external blockchains.

 This contract-calls interoperability  can enhance the connectivity of Hyperledger Fabric, reduce the need for extensive documentation and protocols to link different blockchains, and ultimately minimize service redundancy within the Hyperledger Fabric community.

The final objective of this project is to improve the interoperability of different blockchain networks by developing smart contract gateways that can interact with multiple networks. These gateways will automate, trace, and secure the process of calling smart contracts on different blockchains. The initial focus is on developing gateway smart contracts for connecting multiple separate Hyperledger Fabric networks, and the next step will be to create gateways to connect Hyperledger Fabric to other heterogeneous networks, such as Hyperledger Besu.

Overall, the final project aims to enhance the efficiency, security, and traceability of cross-blockchain transaction submissions, thereby improving the overall functionality of blockchain technology.

Automated-Gateways project is developed under the mentorship program of Linux foundation. Find more information [here](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN).

This project is developed and maintainded by [TCDT Lab](https://tcdt.ca/).
