# Automated-Gateways

We introduces an innovative automated gateway framework, specifically designed to address challenges associated with data and service sharing across diverse blockchain platforms. The solution presented here leverages smart contracts within established blockchain platforms, serving as a means to ascertain and regulate authorization policies. This strategic approach significantly mitigates the necessity to acquire proficiency in new technologies, concurrently reducing reliance on third-party services. Until version 1.0.9, we created the ability of invoking smart contracts on different blockchain, through which can share data and services among different blockchains. So basically Automated Gateways in its current stage can safely connect smart contracts on different hyperledgers to each others.

Prominently user-friendly, the framework features easily navigable APIs, facilitating seamless blockchain connectivity with minimal coding requirements. This obviates the imperative to construct additional infrastructure elements such as bridges, gateways, or modules. Furthermore, our infrastructure exclusively depends on existing blockchain platforms, precluding any dependencies on external interoperability services.
