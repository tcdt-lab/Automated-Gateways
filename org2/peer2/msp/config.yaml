  # For each identity classification that you would like to utilize, specify
  # an OU identifier.
  # You can optionally configure that the OU identifier must be issued by a specific CA
  # or intermediate certificate from your organization. However, it is typical to NOT
  # configure a specific Certificate. By not configuring a specific Certificate, you will be
  # able to add other CA or intermediate certs later, without having to reissue all credentials.
  # For this reason, the sample below comments out the Certificate field.
  ClientOUIdentifier:
    # Certificate: "cacerts/cacert.pem"
    OrganizationalUnitIdentifier: "client"
  PeerOUIdentifier:
    # Certificate: "cacerts/cacert.pem"
    OrganizationalUnitIdentifier: "peer"
  AdminOUIdentifier:
    # Certificate: "cacerts/cacert.pem"
    OrganizationalUnitIdentifier: "admin"
  OrdererOUIdentifier:
    # Certificate: "cacerts/cacert.pem"
    OrganizationalUnitIdentifier: "orderer"
